*FUNCTIONS* 
    *config*(key, secret) 
        Configures the API key and secret. These values have to be

          secret 
            The API secret assigned to your Scribd user account. 
         
        API key and secret values are obtained by signing up for a Scribd 
        account and registering it as an API account. The website will in 
        turn provide you with both values. 
     
    *find*(query, **kwargs) 
        Searches for public documents and returns a list of them. 
         
        Parameters: 
          Refer to User.find() method.

            The user's password. 
     
    *signup*(username, password, email, name=None) 
        Creates a new Scribd user and returns the corresponding User object. 
        The user is already logged in.

    *update*(docs, **fields) 
        A faster way to set the same attribute of many documents. 
         
        Parameters: 
          docs 
            A sequence of document objects. 
          keyword arguments 
            Document attributes to set. 
         
        Example: 
          Instead of: 
         
              for doc in docs: 
                  doc.some`_`attribute`_`1 = some`_`value`_`1 
                  doc.some`_`attribute`_`2 = some`_`value`_`2 
                  doc.save() 
          use: 
         
              update(docs, some`_`attribute`_`1=some`_`value`_`1, 
                           some`_`attribute`_`2=some`_`value`_`2) 
             
        All documents must have the same owner. The operation is faster because 
        it requires only one API call.

        searching for documents and iterating over them.

        The returned document have the owner attribute set to the 
        scribd.api`_`user object.

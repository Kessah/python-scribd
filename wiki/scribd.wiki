          docs 
            A sequence of [Document] objects.

            Document attributes to set. 
         
        Example: 
            Instead of: 
         
                for doc in docs: 
                    doc.some_attribute_1 = some_value_1 
                    doc.some_attribute_2 = some_value_2

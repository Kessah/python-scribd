          Parameters "api`_`key", "api`_`sig", "session`_`key", "my`_`user`_`id" 
          are managed internally by the library.

        Searches for documents and returns a list of them. 
         
        Parameters: 
          Refer to the "Parameters" section of: 
          http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method`_`name=docs.search 
           
          Parameters "api`_`key", "api`_`sig", "session`_`key", "my`_`user`_`id"

          Parameter "num`_`start" is not supported. 
          Parameter "num`_`results" is not supported.

          owner attribute set to this user object. Otherwise it will be 
          the scribd.api`_`user which will impact the ability to change 
          the document's properties. You may set the owner attributes

            the "name" attribute.

        Note. If you're not interested in all documents (currently there 
        may be max. 1000 of them), just stop iterating the generator object.

            Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
            are managed internally by the library. 
           
        Returns: 
            A list of [Document] objects. 
     
    *find*(self, query, `*``*`kwargs) 
        Searches for documents and returns a list of them. 
         
        Parameters:

            http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.search 
           
            Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
            are managed internally by the library. 
         
            Parameter "num_start" is not supported. 
            Parameter "num_results" is not supported. 
           
        Additional parameters: 
          offset 
            (optional) The offset into the list of documents.

            owner attribute set to this user object. Otherwise it will be 
            the scribd.api_user which will impact the ability to change 
            the document's properties. You may set the owner attributes 
            later if you have can determine the documents owner yourself.

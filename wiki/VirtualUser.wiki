class *VirtualUser*([User]) 
 |  Provides an easy way to implement virtual users within the current 
 |  Scribd API account. 
 |   
 |  This is useful if Scribd is used as a backend for a platform with its 
 |  own user authentication system. 
 |   
 |  Virtual users are created just by instantiating this class passing the 
 |  name of the virtual user to the constructor. This will most probably 
 |  by the name used by your own authentication system. 
 |   
 |  Because this is a subclass of the User class, the virtual users provide 
 |  the same set of operations (except get_autologin_url()) as normal users. 
 |   
 |  Resource attributes: 
 |    None. 
 |   
 |  Method resolution order: 
 |      [VirtualUser] 
 |      [User] 
 |      [Resource] 
 |      object 
 |   
 |  Methods defined here: 
 |   
 |  *get_autologin_url*(self, next_path='') 
 |      This method is not supported by virtual users. 
 |

 |  Methods inherited from [User]: 
 |   
 |  *all*(self, **kwargs) 
 |      Returns a list of all user documents. 
 |       
 |      Parameters: 
 |        Refer to the "Parameters" section of: 
 |        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.getList 
 |         
 |        Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
 |        are managed internally by the library. 
 |   
 |  *find*(self, query, **kwargs) 
 |      Searches for documents and returns a list of them. 
 |       
 |      Parameters: 
 |        Refer to the "Parameters" section of: 
 |        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.search 
 |         
 |        Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
 |        are managed internally by the library. 
 |       
 |        Parameter "num_start" is not supported. 
 |        Parameter "num_results" is not supported. 
 |         
 |      Additional parameters: 
 |        offset 
 |          (optional) The offset into the list of documents. 
 |        limit 
 |          (optional) The number of documents to return 
 |          (default 10, max 1000). 
 |       
 |      Note on the "scope" parameter: 
 |        Only if scope=='user', the returned documents will have the 
 |        owner attribute set to this user object. Otherwise it will be 
 |        the scribd.api_user which will impact the ability to change 
 |        the document's properties. You may set the owner attributes 
 |        later if you have can determine the documents owner yourself. 
 |        Refer to the Document class for operations requiring a proper 
 |        owner object. 
 |   
 |  *get*(self, doc_id) 
 |      Returns a document with the specified id. 
 |       
 |      Parameters: 
 |        doc_id 
 |          (required) Identifier of the document to be returned. 
 |          The user has to be the owner of this document. 
 |   
 |  *upload*(self, file, **kwargs) 
 |      Uploads a new document and returns a document object. 
 |       
 |      Parameters: 
 |        Refer to the "Parameters" section of: 
 |        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.upload 
 |       
 |        Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
 |        are managed internally by the library. 
 |       
 |        Parameter "file" has a different meaning: 
 |         
 |        file 
 |          (required) File to upload. Either a file-alike object or an URL 
 |          string. If set to an URL, the file is uploaded from that URL. 
 |          If set to a file object, the file is loaded into memory using the 
 |          read() method and uploaded. The name of the file is obtained from 
 |          the "name" attribute. 
 |   
 |  *xall*(self, **kwargs) 
 |      Similar to all() method but returns a generator object 
 |      iterating over all user documents. 
 |       
 |      Parameters: 
 |        Refer to the "Parameters" section of: 
 |        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.getList 
 |       
 |        Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
 |        are managed internally by the library. 
 |       
 |        Parameter "limit" is not supported. 
 |         
 |      Additional parameters: 
 |        page_size 
 |          (optional) The number of documents acquired by a single API 
 |          call. The generator repeats the calls until all documents are 
 |          returned. 
 |       
 |      Note. If you're not interested in all documents (currently there 
 |      may be max. 1000 of them), just stop iterating the generator object. 
 |   
 |  *xfind*(self, query, **kwargs) 
 |      Similar to find() method but returns a generator object searching 
 |      for documents and iterating over them. 
 |       
 |      Parameters: 
 |        Refer to the "Parameters" section of: 
 |        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.search 
 |         
 |        Parameters "api_key", "api_sig", "session_key", "my_user_id" 
 |        are managed internally by the library. 
 |       
 |        Parameter "num_start" is not supported. 
 |        Parameter "num_results" is not supported. 
 |

 |        page_size

 |          call. The calls are repeated until all documents are returned. 
 |       
 |      Note. If you're not interested in all documents (currently there 
 |      may be max. 1000 of them), just stop iterating the generator object.

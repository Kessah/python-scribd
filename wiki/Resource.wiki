class *Resource*(object) 
    Base class for remote objects that the Scribd API allows 
    to interact with. 
     
    This class is never instantiated, only subclassed. 
     
    Every object features a set of resource attributes that are 
    stored and managed by the Scribd platform. They are accessed 
    and used like any other Python object attributes but are 
    stored in a separate container. 
     
    Methods defined here: 
     
    *get_attributes*(self) 
        Returns a dictionary with the resource attributes. </pre>

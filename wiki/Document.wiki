class *Document*([Resource]) 
    Represents a Scribd document. 
     
    Use methods of the User objects to instantiate. 
     
    Attributes: 
      owner 
        A [User] object owning the document. This always is a valid 
        object but may not be the true owner if it could not be 
        established. This may be the case if the document was obtained 
        from find() or xfind(). In worst case, owner will be set to 
        the scribd.api_user object which is the default user associated 
        with the current API account. 
         
        You may set this attribute if you can determine the true owner 
        yourself. 
         
        A true owner is needed to be able to change the document's 
        attributes. 
     
    Resource attributes: 
        The initial set of the attributes depend on how this object 
        was obtained. 
     
        Refer to "Result explanation" section of: 
        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.getList 
        if the object was obtained by the [User] object's all() or 
        xall() methods. 
       
        Refer to "Result explanation" section of: 
        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.search 
        if the object was obtained by find() or xfind() (either global 
        functions or [User] object's methods). 
       
        Refer to "Result explanation" section of: 
        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.upload 
        if the object was obtained by one of the [User] object's 
        uploads methods. 
     
        Refer to "Result explanation" section of: 
        http://www.scribd.com/developers/api?method_name=docs.getSettings 
        if the object was obtained by the [User] object's get() method. 
     
        If the owner attribute points to a true owner of the document, 
        load() method may be used to obtain the full set of attributes. 
        Refer to the method's documentation for more information.
